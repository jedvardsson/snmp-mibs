        "Acronyms and Definitions

        The following acronyms and terms are used in this
        document:

          DMS:   Digital Media Systems

          DAM:   Digital Asset Management System

          DMM:   Digital Media Manager Application

          VP :   Video Portal Application

          DSM:   Digital Signage Manager Application

          ETV:   Enterprise TV Manager Application

          DMP:   Cisco Digital Media Player

          LAN:   Local Area Network

          Group: A collection of DMS users grouped and
                 managed together as a single entity for
                 administrative convenience.


        Overview of the MIB

        This is a MIB Module for managing and monitoring the physical
        and logical structures in Cisco Digital Media Management System.
        The MIB reflects the structure as follows:
            * show DMS as an coherent, abstract media management system
            * indicate the physical inventory of DMS
            * indicate the media management features active (licensed)
              in the system.
            * show the streaming and storage components and their
              activity
            * elements of DMS security
            * external servers used by the system
            * events and alarms

        Hence, the MIB contains eight major groups of objects organized
        as follows:
         a) DMS System Group:
              This section models distributed DMS as a single abstract
              system.

         b) DMS Features Group:
              This section lists the DMS functions that this
              installation is licensed to perform and those that it
              is not.

         c) DMS Inventory Group:
              This section lists the physical elements that this
              installation of DMS comprises.

         d) Servers Group:
              This section models the external servers used by this
              installation of DMS.

         e) Digital Asset Management (DAM) Services Group:
              This section models the state and activity of various
              content management services that this installation of
              DMS is equipped with. The loose term 'content management'
              has been intentionally used to as to be able to
              accommodate more content management services in this
              model as they evolve.

         f) Security Group:
              This section defines the security configuration and
              activity of this installation of DMS.

         g) Fault Tolerance Group:
              This section models the redundancy (failover and
              load balancing) configuration of this installation of
              DMS and the associated activity.

         h) User Management Group:
              This section models the configured DMS users, groups
              and the associated activity.

         i) Events and Faults Group:
              This section models the events, alarms and notifications
              reported by this installation of DMS.

         j) Capacity Group:
              This section is planned for the future and would define
              the limits and/capacities of functions of DMS. These
              include limits such as the type of media encodings that
              are supported, the maximum number of media players that
              may be managed etc.

         k) Resource Usage Group:
              This section is planned for the future and would define
              the current resource usage by DMS.
              This would include the amount of storage used by DMS,
              the number of encoders currently in use etc.

         l) Threshold group (allows definition of high water marks)
              This section is planned for the future and would allow
              the management entity to define thresholds to set high
              water marks on critical metrics.

         m) Notifications
              This section defines notifications to signal
              significant events pertaining to this installation of
              DMS."
