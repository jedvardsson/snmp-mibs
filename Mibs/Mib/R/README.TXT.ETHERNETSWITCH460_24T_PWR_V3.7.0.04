The following files:
    readme.txt:    this file
    manifest:      a list of the MIB files included in this archive
    compileorder:  the order in which the MIB files in this archive
                   should be compiled and loaded
    supported.<product/version>:  a list of supported OIDs
    changes.<product/version>:  a list of MIB files that have
                   changed since the previous archive
    oidchanges.<product/version>:  a list of changes in the OID
                   support since the last archive
    *.mib:         the MIB files required to manage the supported
                   products/versions

Note that MIB archives now use a standardized form for MIB file
names.  The format is based on the MIB module name, and is of the
following form:

    MIB-DEFINITION-NAME.mib

A complete list of MIB file name changes can be found in the
changes.<product/version> files.

NOTE: Due to the MIB file name changes you should not extract these
      MIB files to the same location (i.e. directory) as a previous
      version and then recompile.  This will result in two MIB files
      with the same OIDs, which will produce compile conflicts.

      If you are using a tool that imports MIB files by name (i.e.
      HP Openview) then you must remove the previous definition
      before importing the new MIB file.
